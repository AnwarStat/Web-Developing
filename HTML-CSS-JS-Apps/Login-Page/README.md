```bash
git fetch
```
### 42. How to check the current commits log of a remote repo in Git
Commit after commit, Git builds up a log. You can find out the remote repository log by using this command:
```bash
git log origin/main
```
### 43. How to merge a remote repo with your local repo in Git:
If the remote repository has changes you want to merge with your local, then this command will do that for you:

```
### 47. How to use Git rebase:
You can transfer completed work from one branch to another using git rebase.
```bash
git rebase branch_name_here
```
Git Rebase can get really messy if you don't do it properly. Before using this command I suggest that you re-read the official documentation here

### 48. How to run rebase interactively in Git:
You can run git rebase interactively using the -i flag.
It will open the editor and present a set of commands you can use.
```bash
git rebase -i master
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
```
### 49. How to force a push request in Git:
This command will force a push request. This is usually fine for pull request branches because nobody else should have cloned them.
But this isn't something that you want to do with public repos.
```bash

```
